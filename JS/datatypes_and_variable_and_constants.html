	/* 
		Rules while creating the Identifiers in JS 
		
			1) Identifier name should not be a reserve word
			2) Identifier name shouldn't start with number, but it contains Number

				Ex: 

					var 5g;- Invalid variable name because it starts with number

					var g5; - valid

			3) Identifier names shouldn't contain any special characters other than 'underscore(_)' or $

				Ex: - 

				var trainer name = 'Murali P'; - invalid because 'space' we used 

				var trainer_name = 'Murali P'; - valid

				var trainer$name = 'Murali P'; valid
